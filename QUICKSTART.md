- Check the backup directory for timestamped folders

## 📊 Sample Data Overview

The sample data includes:
- **5 Students** with realistic information
- **8 Courses** across different departments
- **12 Enrollments** with completed grades
- **GPA calculations** already computed

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Student not found"**
   - Make sure you've imported the sample data
   - Check that student IDs match exactly (case-sensitive)

2. **"Course not found"**
   - Ensure courses are imported from sample data
   - Verify course IDs are correct

3. **Compilation errors**
   - Make sure you're using Java 8 or higher
   - Check that all source files are present

4. **File not found errors**
   - Ensure you're running from the project root directory
   - Check that sample_data folder exists
